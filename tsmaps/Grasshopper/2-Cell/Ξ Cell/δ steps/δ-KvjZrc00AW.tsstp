#### Requirements to follow along:

- {{gl.rhino-link}}, and the HAL Robotics Framework installed on a PC.
- Basic modelling skills in Rhinoceros 3D and Vector/Plane manipulation skills in Grasshopper will greatly help preparing your own {{gl.positioner-link}} model.
- Reading or watching the [Create a Multi-Part Tool]{{ghl.grasshopper-multi-part-tool-link-D}} tutorial is highly recommended as this tutorial builds on some of its learnings.
