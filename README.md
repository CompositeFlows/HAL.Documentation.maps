# Docs Assembler example repo

This folder contains a fork of the HAL Robotics documentation repo, initialised to use maps.   
It serves as a good example for simple use cases - as there are only shared variables and steps, no linked maps. 
#### BE AWARE: This is not the current version of HAL Robotics documentation - see below


## Docs Assembler - build documentation like Lego

- Reuse of interchangeable **blocks** and **fragments** of text.
- A [strategy](#notes) that mirrors **classes** and **variables** in programming.
- Streamlines development and simplifies editing on growing or complex systems.
  


This is an experimental port from a c# server/database application - to a GitHub repo/extension. A concept driven by transformational conversations with a robotics firm - [HAL Robotics](https://hal-robotics.com), so their documentation could be edited as markdown files, stored in their git repo, and compiled into manuals, diagnostic/solution walkthroughs, manufacturer specific guides etc - all based on a policy of ***edit once - update globally*** - like with **classes** and **components** in code.
